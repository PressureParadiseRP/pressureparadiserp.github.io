      <h1 data-search-item>⚖️ Faction Rules of Engagement</h1>

      <p data-search-item>
        The purpose of these Faction rules is to provide clear guidance and expectations for all whitelisted factions under Pressure in Paradise RP Faction Management.
        This document covers faction management standards, protocol, and conflict rules you must follow while operating as a faction.
      </p>

      <p data-search-item>
        Rules are subject to change. Any updates (and/or rule violations) will be communicated through announcements in the faction Discord.
        You are expected to bookmark this document and reference it regularly to avoid preventable rule breaks.
      </p>

      <p data-search-item>
        Factions that do not comply with these rules (and/or server rules) may be subject to faction strikes, disbandment, member removals, and/or faction perks being revoked.
        Certain situations may be handled directly by City Government processes and may not involve Faction Management (example: VDM/RDM).
      </p>

      <p data-search-item>
        <b>Strike policy:</b> After <b>5 strikes</b>, a faction will be disbanded and faction property (including hoods/turfs) will be removed and made available for new factions.
        Faction Management may also disband a faction due to repeated reports of subpar RP.
        Leaders may submit a ticket to appeal a strike; appeals are reviewed and may be denied.
      </p>

            <b>FRP robberies:</b> Failing to comply with a robbery and not valuing your life.

            Your faction has <b>12 hours of playtime</b> to locate you for a CK scene.
            Avoiding RP and not flying is not tolerated — your playtime must reach an additional 12 hours from when the CK is submitted.
            Management will CK otherwise. You cannot dodge CKs by switching characters or “flying in on another soul.”
