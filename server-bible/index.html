      <p data-search-item>
        This Server Bible protects RP quality, fairness, and community safety in Pressure in Paradise RP.
        These rules exist to keep scenes meaningful, prevent “win-at-all-costs” behavior, and maintain consistent expectations for everyone.
      </p>

      <p data-search-item>
        <b>Owner Discretion:</b> Leadership reserves the right to interpret and enforce these rules based on severity,
        intent, impact, and pattern of behavior. Rules may be updated at any time. If a situation is not explicitly listed,
        leadership may still take action to protect the server and its players.

          <li data-search-item>“I saw it on a clip” does not make it valid IC knowledge.</li>

        <h3 data-search-item>Definition</h3>
        <p data-search-item>
